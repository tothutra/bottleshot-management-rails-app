Things I learned building the first app

1-Start simple and add on add we go
  I started out with very simple models: User and Bottleshots. Each with 2-3 attribute tops.
  Building out CRUD is so much less intimidating. Once I get those to work, it became a solid framework to add on all the details.
  Ain't nobody got time for being overwhelmed!

2-Break down into steps. Tackle it one at a time.
  I keep an ongoing note.md as I build the task. My minds runs a millions miles a minute once in the zone. keeping the note is a good place to keep myself streamlined and organized. Ideas I have while working on a task doesn't get lost. it makes it super easy to keep commit message and branches name make sense.

3-Stub out first, fill in the space later.
  Consistently, when building a page, I stubbed out all the elements first to have a good understanding of how I want the UI flow to be.

4-At some point, let the child go.
  Once you get the hang of things, it became really addictive to keep adding and adding information and functionality. For the sake of the review. Stop. It's a bit counter intuitive but I constantly have to refocus myself 

5-Before starting to work on the OmniAuth part, here's a quote for you:
