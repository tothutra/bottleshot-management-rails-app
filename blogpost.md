Things I learned building the first app

1-Start simple and add on add we go
  I started out with very simple models: User and Bottleshots. Each with 2-3 attribute tops.
  Building out CRUD is so much less intimidating. Once I get those to work, it became a solid framework to add on all the details.
  Ain't nobody got time for being overwhelmed!

2-Break down into steps. Tackle it one at a time.
  I keep an ongoing note.md as I build the task. My minds runs a millions miles a minute once in the zone. keeping the note is a good place to keep myself streamlined and organized. Ideas I have while working on a task doesn't get lost. it makes it super easy to keep commit message and branches name make sense.

3-Stub out first, fill in the space later.
  Consistently, when building a page, I stubbed out all the elements first to have a good understanding of how I want the UI flow to be.
